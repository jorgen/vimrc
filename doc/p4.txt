==============================================================================
1. Mappings						*p4-mappings*

See the |<Leader>| help page for a discussion on how to customize the
mappings. The default is a backslash.

GLOBAL MAPPINGS

Global mappings can be used in all buffers.

<Leader>e
<Plug>P4Edit		Does a "p4 edit" on the current file.

<Leader>f
<Plug>P4Filelog		Does a "p4 filelog -l" on the current file.

<Leader>d
<Plug>P4Diff		Does a "p4 diff -du" on the current file.

<Leader>a
<Plug>P4Annotate	Does a "p4 annotate -q" on the current file.

LOCAL MAPPINGS

Local mappings can only be used in the p4 window.

CTRL-]			If the word under the cursor is a number, this mapping
			interprets it as a changenumber and does a
				"p4 describe -du"
			on it. Otherwise it interprets the word under the
			cursor as a depot path and opens the file in a new
			window.

CTRL-T			Jumps back to the previous p4 display.

==============================================================================
2. Commands						*p4-commands*

:Pdiff
			Does a "p4 diff -du".

:Pdiff {filename}
			Does a "p4 diff -du {filename}".

:Psync
			Does a "p4 sync" on the current file.

			Does a "p4 sync" on the current file to the change
			number {changenumber}.

:Pdescribe {changenumber}
			Does a "p4 describe -du {changenumber}".
